## Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation with Discrete Units

I initially attempted to use unitY but faced issues running it successfully. 
I have now decided to revert to using Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation with Discrete Units for my project. 
I found a helpful implementation video, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIAt9kawqsQ&list=PLvELbYeZ7GEFsYxurUXIXpmksCUz6-Z5M&index=6).
