## Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation with Discrete Units

I initially attempted to use unitY but faced issues running it successfully. 
I have now decided to revert to using Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation with Discrete Units for my project. 
a helpful implementation video, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIAt9kawqsQ&list=PLvELbYeZ7GEFsYxurUXIXpmksCUz6-Z5M&index=6).

## a new pipeline for data filtering
### acoustic noise(how to filter background from the audio)
detection of human speech by targeting a specific frequency range (300 Hz to 1500 Hz), isolating speech in complex audio data. [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05815)
